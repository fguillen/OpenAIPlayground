- February: 73,242
- March: 81,974
- April: 160,204
- May: 150,451
- June: 190,813
- July: 280,710
- August: 313,335
- September: 155,596
- October: 92,893
- November: 78,945
- December: 133,334

In 2023:
- January: 80,706
- February: 68,341
- March: 74,120
- April: 148,413
- May: 139,990
- June: 171,423

- August: 288,566
- September: 144,885

The month with the higher costs in 2024 is August, with 313,335 costs.

2. The costs in the month with higher costs (August 2024) were 313,335.

3. To find the month with the biggest increase in costs from the same month in the previous year, I will calculate the difference between the costs of each month in 2024 and the costs of the same month in 2023.

- January: 86,379 - 80,706 = 5,673
- February: 73,242 - 68,341 = 4,901
- March: 81,974 - 74,120 = 7,854
- April: 160,204 - 148,413 = 11,791
- May: 150,451 - 139,990 = 10,461
- June: 190,813 - 171,423 = 19,390
- July: 280,710 - 262,952 = 17,758
- August: 313,335 - 288,566 = 24,769
- September: 155,596 - 144,885 = 10,711
- October: 92,893 - 86,596 = 6,297
- November: 78,945 - 73,365 = 5,580
- December: 133,334 - 119,042 = 14,292

The month with the biggest increase in costs from the same month in the previous year is August, with an increase of 24,769.
