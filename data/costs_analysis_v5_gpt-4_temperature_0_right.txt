  - August: 288566
  - September: 144885
  - October: 86596
  - November: 73365
  - December: 119042

### Analysis:

#### 1. Month with Higher Costs:
- The highest cost in 2024 is in August with 313,335.
- The highest cost in 2023 is in August with 288,566.

So, the month with the highest costs overall is **August 2024**.

#### 2. Costs in the Month with Higher Costs:
- The cost in August 2024 is **313,335**.

#### 3. Month with the Biggest Increase in Costs from the Same Month in the Previous Year:
To find the biggest increase, we calculate the difference for each month:

- January: 86379 - 80706 = 5673
- February: 73242 - 68341 = 4901
- March: 81974 - 74120 = 7854
- April: 160204 - 148413 = 11791
- May: 150451 - 139990 = 10461
- June: 190813 - 171423 = 19390
- July: 280710 - 262952 = 17758
- August: 313335 - 288566 = 24769
- September: 155596 - 144885 = 10711
- October: 92893 - 86596 = 6297
- November: 78945 - 73365 = 5580
- December: 133334 - 119042 = 14292

The month with the biggest increase in costs from the same month in the previous year is **August**, with an increase of **24,769**.

### Summary:
1. The month with the highest costs is **August 2024**.
2. The costs in the month with the highest costs (August 2024) are **313,335**.
3. The month with the biggest increase in costs from the same month in the previous year is **August**, with an increase of **24,769**.
